Although you start with nearly 3 miles of steady climbing, the grade is never severe and, before you know it, you're at the top.  Pick up a map at the trailhead and start climbing the gulch. At about a mile, you may see a trail back and to your left--ignore it--this is where you'll come out later.  After about a mile and a half you'll come to a trail junction(513.2).  Stay left to remain on this loop.  Follow the trail until it reaches a dirt road and go left.  After 0.7 miles on the doubletrack, look left for a trail dropping into the woods.  This is where the fun begins.  The start of the descent has fantastic flow through the woods and you can really enjoy some speed.  Then it gets steeper and more technical.  There's one rock drop lying in wait to catch the unwary and unskilled.  Eventually, you will merge with the trail you started on as you were climbing the gulch.  Turn right and plummet back to your car--carefully, however, as this trail is also popular with hikers/dog=walkers.",
